# Advanced-Logistic-Regression
Many suspect that logistic regression is performed on non-linear data and that this separates logistic regression from linear regression.  This is not accurate as when y values are discrete, they can have values that are less than zero or greater than one.  Linear regression is not appropriate in such cases because the residuals will not be normally distributed. Logistic regression attempts to draw a line between two features maximizing the probability that a point on one side of the line will be properly classified.  This is performed with an activation function, like the sigmoid function, a log loss function to minimize loss and a regularization term.  Different regularization values will be explored within a logistic regression model with 5-fold cross-validation on a data set relating weight vs. height for males and females.  Subsequently, grid search cross-validation will be utilized to find the best model with the best accuracy where the regularization term has been optimized.  The differences between iterative structures and grid search will be cited.
